// POST FORMATS
// These are similar to categories, distinguishing posts from one another.
// They are useful mostly because they are standardized.
// http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats
//
// AI supports most post formats.
// (standard, aside, link, image, quote, status, video)
//
// Standard is displayed as a block, with the post thumbnail serving as a
// fixed background image, and the header and lead being displayed on top of it.
// It is possible to click on these to be taken to the full article.
//
// All other formats are displayed as plates, with the icon sitting in the left,
// metadata sitting next to it, and content sitting on the right. With the
// exception of aside, these are not meant to be clicked on and read further.
//
// If at all possible, I am interested in changing the way some of these are
// displayed (these being the formats that use plates). I really like the way
// quotes, statuses, and links are displayed. But I'd like asides to be more
// article-like, and photos and videos (and galleries, eventually) to be more
// media-centric.
//
// AI is currently missing support for only three formats.
// (gallery, audio, chat)
// I am very interested in adding gallery, less so in audio, and not at all
// in chat.
